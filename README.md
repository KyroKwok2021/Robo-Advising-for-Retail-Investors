# Robo Advising for Retail Investors

## Overview
This project delves into the trading strategy development and implementation of a robo-advising system crafted for retail investors, highlighting a growing trend in the intersection of technology and finance. It forcused on a **mean reversion strategy** by leveraging the correlation between **VIX** and **VIX Future** to predict the **SPX** market movement. To enhance accessibility and real-time interaction, the system is also integrated with a **Discord bot** to deliver daily simplfied trading signals directly to users.
